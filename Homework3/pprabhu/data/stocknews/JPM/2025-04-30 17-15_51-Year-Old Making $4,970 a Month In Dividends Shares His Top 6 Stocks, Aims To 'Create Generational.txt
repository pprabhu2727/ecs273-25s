Dividend stocks are gaining ground as investors scramble to safeguard their portfolios amid the ongoing US-China trade war.

A few days ago, a dividend investor shared his income report and holdings on r/Dividends — a community of income investors with over 700,000 followers. The portfolio details shared by the investor showed his monthly dividend income was roughly $4,973. The investor said he had about $1.2 million in cash equivalents, like certificates of deposit and money market funds, with paid-off house and cars.
The investor, who plans to retire in three years, said he had “ignored” dividend stocks until recently but began shifting into income-generating investments following the recent market pullback.
"I don't want to lose the growth aspect of my portfolio as I want to see it continue to grow," he wrote. "We plan to use the nearly $5000 monthly dividend income as of today and reinvest the dividends for the next 8.5 years."

The investor said his portfolio was down about 12.5% in 2025 as of the time of his post. He sold tech equities where he had already secured "huge" gains to pile into dividend stocks.
"We have five kids aged 17-23 and the goal was to create generational wealth for them and their future families," he added.
