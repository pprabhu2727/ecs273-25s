# Homework 3 Templates

AI and various online resources were used to help me complete this assignment. 
Some sections utilized code from existing templates.

Some resources include (but not limited to):
Source: options.tsx
Source: https://observablehq.com/@d3/line-chart/2
Source: https://observablehq.com/@d3/zoomable-area-chart
Source: https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/custom_legend.html



This repository contains multiple templates:

- `react-js-example`: A template based on react and javascript.
- `react-ts-example`: A template based on react and typescript.

## Usage

Each template is self-contained. Navigate into a folder and install dependencies:

```bash
cd react-example
npm install
npm run dev
```
