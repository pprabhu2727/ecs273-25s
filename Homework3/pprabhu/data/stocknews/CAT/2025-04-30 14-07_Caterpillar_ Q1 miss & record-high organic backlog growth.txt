Shares of caterpillar, they are fluctuating here this morning as it's been oscillating between gains and losses, as right now it is flat, just barely to the downside after the company missed on earnings, but reported record organic backlog growth of $5 billion in the quarter. Shares, as you could see right now, they are sitting flat, just about 2/10 of a percent lower. Here's a look at the actuals versus the estimates here and it was a beat on revenue, slight miss on adjusted EPS, or excuse me, miss on revenue and EPS as my own kind of vision is calibrating here. One thing that my vision doesn't have to calibrate very much around is all of the parentheses around some of the segments and geographic region breakouts that the company puts within its earnings report. There were, and and that's not a good thing by the way, that just means that you saw a year over year decline, notably construction industries across every segment and every um region geographic region saw declines here in the US or North America rather, was down by 24%. And then additionally, in EMEA or the European region, that was down by 13%, Latin America 15%. Oh yeah, down 12% in Asia Pacific. What does it spell out? Not a great picture for one of the largest revenue contributors for the company here. But ultimately, one of the bright spots was energy and transportation, at least here in the North America segment there.
Yeah, tough headline numbers, when you look at that record backlog growth, that's what analysts are pointing out in their notes this morning, that $5 billion in organic backlog growth, meaning that future demand might be strong, which is a good indicator for a company that's obviously impacted by government spending on things like infrastructure that has obviously come down under this administration. And that may be why you're seeing these shares pop back and forth between the green and the red this morning. That backlog growth number, a potential positive in this print.
The headline numbers for Caterpillar (CAT) give insight into how the company performed in the quarter ended March 2025, but it may be worthwhile to compare some of its key metrics to Wall Street estimates and the year-ago actuals.
Here’s a sector-by-sector breakdown of how major players are reacting to the mounting pressure of tariffs and retaliatory trade measures. The post 20 company reactions — good and bad — to Trump’s tariff war appeared first on FreightWaves.
Uncertainty continues to hang over the latest round of financial results and forecasts for companies both big and small as they try to navigate a global trade system severely shaken by a shift in U.S. policy.  Tariffs and the stark shift in policy has also shaken consumer and business confidence.  The U.S. economy shrank during the first quarter of the year, its first drop in three years.
Caterpillar estimates the Trump administration's tariffs will add $250 million to $350 million in additional costs this quarter.  "We'd like to see a little more clarity," said Joe Creed, who will become chief executive on Thursday.  Creed said the company is cutting back on discretionary spending and slowing some shipments of imported products that would face tariffs.
