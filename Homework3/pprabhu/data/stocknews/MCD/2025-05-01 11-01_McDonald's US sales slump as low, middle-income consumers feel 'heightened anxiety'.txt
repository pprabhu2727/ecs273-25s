McDonald's (MCD) reported first quarter earnings that missed Wall Street expectations on Thursday, as a drop in sales and traffic in the US weighed on results at the fast food giant.
McDonald's reported first quarter revenue of $5.96 billion, which came in below the $6.12 billion expected, according to Bloomberg data. This marked a 3% decline from the prior year period.
Global comparable sales — or sales at restaurants in operation for more than one year — fell 1%, led by a 3.6% drop in US same-store sales as fewer customers visited McDonald's in its home country. Wall Street analysts had, on average, expected global comparable sales to rise 0.5% and US sales to fall a more modest 1%.

"During the first quarter, geopolitical tensions added to the economic uncertainty and dampened consumer sentiment more than we expected," said CEO Chris Kempczinski in a call with analysts following the results.
Kempczinski said traffic from low-income consumers fell "nearly double digits versus the prior quarter" and that from middle-income customers fell "nearly as much," while visits from high-income consumers "remained solid."
Adjusted earnings per share tallied $2.67 in the quarter, a penny below the $2.68 expected. McDonald's stock dropped 1.9% Thursday following the results.
The CEO said the divide illustrated "the divided US economy where low- and middle-income consumers are being particularly weighed down by the cumulative impact of inflation and heightened anxiety about the economic outlook."
"Overall the results did not surprise us — we have been flagging the consumer weakness that disproportionately impacts the lower income consumers — McDonald's core customer cohorts," wrote Bernstein analyst Danilo Gargiulo following the report. Gargiulo holds a Market Perform rating on the stock.
President Trump's trade policies have dragged down consumer sentiment, pushed inflation expectations to their highest levels since the 1980s, and raised fears of an impending recession. On Wednesday, data showed the US economy contracted for the first time in three years during the first three months of 2025.

The challenging economic environment for consumers has weighed on McDonald's and its fast food peers. In February, McDonald's fourth quarter earnings missed Wall Street's estimates.
On Thursday, the company reaffirmed its 2025 fiscal year financial targets.
Wall Street had hoped the American fast food giant would show signs of stabilizing after a lackluster performance in the fourth quarter as the company faced declining sales and an E. coli outbreak. Those results marked a "low point in recent history for the brand," Citi analyst Jon Tower noted at the time.
McDonald's has sought to stave off competition by introducing new deals over the past year as customers looked to save money by eating at home and rivals launched value offerings.
That includes a $5 meal deal last summer and the company's McValue menu launched in January. Analysts have said the results of the chain's value offerings likely won't show up until the second half of the year.
But with the stock outperforming so far this year — up 10% against a roughly 5% drop for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) — investors were optimistic that results would be able to hold up in what has become an increasingly challenging consumer environment.
Analysts at UBS, HSBC, and Morgan Stanley have called McDonald's a "defensive" stock pick in recent notes to investors.
Still, the company could face pressures abroad, with anti-American sentiment toward some US brands on the rise as a result of Trump's trade war. More than half of the chain's revenue comes from abroad, and China is its second-largest and fastest-growing market.
The chain reported that same-store sales in its international developmental licensed markets segment — which includes 75 international markets such as Japan, China, and Brazil — rose 3.5%, ahead of the 3.3% expected by Wall Street analysts.
The rise was driven by the Middle East and Japan, the company said. McDonald's CFO Ian Borden told analysts that "performance remained stable" in China.
At the same time, comparable sales in its international operated markets — which include 16 markets such as Canada, Australia, UK, France, and Germany — fell 1%, driven by declining sales in the UK. Analysts had expected the company's same-store sales in these markets to rise a modest 0.3%.
